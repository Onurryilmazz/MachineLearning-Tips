# Prediction Tutorial on Tips Dataset

In this repository I worked with the raw dataset A Waiter's Tips available on Kaggle. First I visualized the data and then I did an EDA. After preprocessing, I created models with many models I determined and visualized the results. I showed the results of Linear Regression, which I got the best results, at the end.
